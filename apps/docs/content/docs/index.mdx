---

## Introduction

**Modbox** is a modular JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript and TypeScript code in a flexible and isolated environment, built on top of `es-module-shims`. It supports various plugins for module resolution, caching, and code transformation, redefining how modules are processed at runtime.

### Why Modbox?

In today's web development, rigid build tools often limit innovation. Modbox offers a powerful alternative for scenarios demanding **unprecedented control** over module handling. It helps you:

- **Gain Granular Control:** Fine-tune every step of module processing, moving beyond monolithic bundlers.
- **Embrace Extreme Modularity:** Build custom pipelines by adding, removing, or reordering plugins.
- **Power Dynamic Environments:** Perfect for code playgrounds, online editors, and any app needing real-time code manipulation.
- **Leverage Modern Tech:** We stand on the shoulders of giants, orchestrating `es-module-shims` for robust module loading and `SWC-Wasm` for blazing-fast code transformations directly in the browser.
